# Abilities and Statistics

There are two broad category of numbers for a character: Abilities and Statistics.

## Abilities

An Ability represents a character's capacity to perform a broad range of tasks.

There are five Abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Influence, Will and Power.

### Strength (STR)

Strength represents the physical capability to affect the real world. Pretty much works like Strength abilities in other games.

The original name for this ability was "Muscle", until I realized that starting every ability score name with the letter "M" was a bad idea.

If it can lift things, a character has an STR. Average human STR is 3.

### Dexterity (DEX)

Dexterity represents the physical ability to move and do things that require fine motor control. Pretty much works like the Dexterity ability for other games.

The original name for this ability was "Moves", until I realized that starting every ability score name with the letter "M" was a bad idea.

If it can move, a character has a DEX. Average human DEX is 3.

### Influence (INF)

Influence represents the ability to socially, emotionally, and mentally influence others. In other games it would be called Charisma.

The original name for this ability was "Moxie", until I realized that starting every ability score name with the letter "M" was a bad idea.

If it can talk and/or socialize, a character has an INF. Average human INF is 3.

Things that don't have INF are undead and constructs.

### Will (WIL)

Will represents intellectual capacity and mental fortitude. Other games call this Intelligence or Wisdom.

The original name for this ability was "Mind", until I realized that starting every ability score name with the letter "M" was a bad idea.

If it can think and reason, a character has a WIL.

Things that do not have a WIL are mindless forms of undead and constructs.

### Power (POW)

Power represents your character's mastery over supernatural and metaphysical forces. Not all game have an equivalent.

The original name for this ability was "Magic", until I realized that starting every ability score name with the letter "M" was a bad idea. 

Having POW is uncommon. Most humans have a zero. 

## Statistics

There are three statistics: HP, MP, and Mana.

### HP

HP doesn't officially stand for anything. You can call it Hit Points, Health Points, Hits, or whatever.

When a character takes physical damage, their HP lowers.

At 0 HP, the character falls unconscious, and will not revive without aid.

Below 0 HP, the character dies.

Average human HP is 3.

### MP

MP doesn't officially stand for anything either. You can call it Mind Points or Morale Points.

When a character takes "phychological damage", their MP is lowered.

At 0 MP, the character must either surrender or run.

Below MP, the character is catatonic. They will follow simple instructions but have no will of their own.

### Mana

Mana is an internal battery for bringing out supernatural or metaphysical effects.

Normal humans start out with 1 Mana. They spend it to bring about supernatural effects.

When at 0 Mana, a character may, if desired, continue to bring about supernatural effects, but must instead spend 1HP or 1MP to do so.
