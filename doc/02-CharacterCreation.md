# Character Creation

Character creation takes usually less than 30 seconds.

# Step One: Base Ability Scores

Start with a character sheet with the minimum ability scores for a character:

| Ability | Value |
| --- | --- |
| STR | 1 |
| DEX | 1 |
| INF | 1 |
| WIL | 1 |
| POW | 0 |

# Step Two: Ability Score Roll

Roll 8d6. Consider each die separately:

* For every 1 rolled, increase STR by 1.
* For every 2 rolled, increase DEX by 1.
* For every 3 rolled, increase INF by 1.
* For every 4 rolled, increase WIL by 1.

Reroll any 5 and 6 in the next step.

# Step Three: Ability Score Reroll

If you rolled no 5 or 6 with your original roll, the character is done.

Reroll any 5 or 6, and consider them separately.

* For every 1-4 rolled, interpret as during Step Two.
* For every 5 rolled, increase POW by 1.
* For every 6 rolled, choose the ability to increase by 1.

# Step Four: Incentives

If you do not have any incentive levels, then your character is done.

Otherwise, roll incentives and apply them. New players have no incentives initially.

# Step Five: Stat Up and GO!

Your character starts with 3 HP, 3 MP, and 1 Mana, if an incentive doesn't increase any of these amounts.

There are no character classes, races, kits, or equipment outside of what an incentive might have given you.

May your characters run be long and/or glorious! SPLORR!!
