# The Core Game Mechanic

The entire game of SPLORR!! TTRPG is based on a player being able to do the following things:

* Correctly identify a d6.
* Based on a number(often an ability score), the ability to select that quantity of d6s.
* The ability to roll such a quantity of d6s.
* The ability to identify and count how many 6s appear on the dice just rolled.

It is pretty much that simple.

## Against Inanimate Objects (Static Difficulty)

Example: 

    You want to move a heavy something that a normal person would not be able to lift.  The GM rules that it is movable with a STR roll of 2. Your character has a STR 3, and so you roll 3d6 and count how many sixes. If you get 2 6s, then you move the thing. If you do not(and with a STR 3, you probably do not), you should find a friend to help you or use a tool or something.  Heavy things are heavy. Also, lift with your legs, not with your back.

## Against Another Character (Dynamic Difficulty)

Sometimes the GM assigns a number, and sometimes it is a character v. character action.

Example:

    You have been challenged to an arm wrestling contest. You have a STR 3, and your opponent has a STR 5. Each character rolls their STR and whoever gets the bigger number wins. The rule about ties is this: the defender does not lose, which is different than the defender winning. In an arm wrestling contest, this means a draw. In other things like combat, it means that the defender is unharmed, and so in a manner of speaking can be said to have "won", but in reality simply "did not lose".
