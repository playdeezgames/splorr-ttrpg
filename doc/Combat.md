# Combat

There are two arenas of combat, physical(dealing with HP) and mental (dealing with MP).

## Physical Combat

One character attempts to physically strike another.

That makes them the attacker.

The attacker makes an attack roll.

That attack roll is based on the Strength and added to by whatever they are wielding as a weapon.

If the attack roll is zero, then we're done. Next character gets a chance to act.

The defender makes a defend roll.

The defend roll is based on the Moves adjusted for any items that aid in this mark.

Damage is the attack roll minus the defend roll, limited by the maximum damage of the weapon. The maximum damage of no weapon is 1.

### Example Weapon: Fist

| Stat | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Fist (always equipped when no other weapon available) |
| Max Damage | 1 |
| HP | Infinite (never breaks) |
| Saving Throw | 2+ |
| Special | A saving throw of 1 injures yer character, and they lose 1 physical strike |

### Example Weapon: Dagger

| Stat | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Dagger |
| Max Damage | 1 |
| HP | 1 |
| Saving Throw | 3+ |
| Special | Does not at first seem to be better than the fist at dealing damage. However, when a dagger fails its saving throw, yer character isn't physically injured, and that's something! |


If damage is positive, then the defender takes HP according to the damage, either to some sort of armor they are wearing or to their body.

If the damage is taken by armor, perform a saving throw or it take HP damage. Once armor is out of HP, it is damaged and no longer useful in combat until repaired.

If damage is applied to armor, the weapon used must make a saving throw or it is struck or damaged in a similar manner to armor.

When a character's own HP are gone, they are incapacitated and unconscious. Overkill will kill the character immediately. Incapacitated characters offer no defense for further HP damage, and any further physical strikes will kill the character.

## Mental Combat

One character attempts to taunt, intimidate, or belittle another character.

This character is called the Attacker.

The Attacker rolls their Moxie, with whatever Moxie enhancements they may have. This is the attack roll.

If the attack roll is zero, go no further. Next character' action.

The Defender rolls their Mind, with whatever Mind enhancements they may have. This the defend roll.

Damage is attack roll minus defend roll, limited by the maximum damage for the "weapon". If there is no weapon, the maximum damage is 1.

The damage is applied either to the defender's MP or to some item that adds to Willpower that also has MP. These are rare, but do exist, like a medicine bag. Treat these things like armor. They have a saving throw just like armor.

If the attacker is using some sort of item to enhance their Moxie for this attack, it, too must make a saving throw or take MP.

Once the defender is brought to zero or lower in MP, they surrender or run. They can no longer bear to fight.

So that's a cool mechanic... using mental combat to subdue yer foes.

But it gives rise quickly to all sorts of abuse, so we have different rules for when you can use mental combat versus when you cannnot.

Pretty much all the time you can engage in physical combat. Most of those times are a bad idea, but the _possibility_ still exists.

If yer character and their party is in a superior tactical position, like more people, stronger people, etc, then the enemy cannot whittle you down with mental attacks.

Similarly, if the reason for fighting is driven by previously demonstrated values held by the character, then it can be ruled that they might be immune to such attack, or at least have some sort of "mental armor" as a result. It is situational.

Generally mental combat is for when you've outnumbered, cornered, and outclassed yer enemy, but don't want to kill them because you can make more money capturing and ransoming them.

# Moar Questions You Did Not Ask

## Mental Combat? Why?

In a brutal world, brutal things happen.

Most enemies are content to kill you and take whatever you happen to be carrying. Life is cheap in SPLORR!!

Others wish to.... make use of your labor, or to trade goods for the use of your labor to others. In a brutal world atrocious things happen.

## What happens to weapons and armor and other things that are damaged in combat?

You fix it, duh.

Broken things either require strength (Strength), manual dexterity (Dexterity), or brain power (Willpower) to repair. Usually there is a need for supplied to aid with this repair. You'll figure it out.

If you don't have any of those things, you might try convincing a skilled laborer (with yer Influence) to do it for you at a fair price.

Or, you just get a new one. Maybe you can loot those orcs you killed for a new short sword....

## Who goes first in combat?

I don't know! Flip a coin or something!

# An Example of Physical Combat

v.

Booger the Goblin (Strength: 4(2 base + 2 for club(max damage 2)), Dexterity 3(no armor), HP: 1)

Booger wins the coin flip, rolls 1 attack.

No damage.

Arlene's turn:
