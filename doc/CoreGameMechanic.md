# The Core Game Mechanic

It is assumed that a character can walk, talk, sleep, eat and poop without difficulty (usually), and so for stuff like that... it just gets done.

Eventually, yer character will want to do something for which there is a chance of failure. Usually this is combat, but in SPLORR!! TTRPG, pretty much everything is handled like combat.

There is an Ability Score that a character wishes to use to bring about their desired effect. For example: punch goblin in the neck(use STR), or climb up a rope(STR or DEX), or open a stuck door(STR), or swim away from a hungry crocodile(DEX), or convince a merchant that his prices need to be lower (INF) or figure out how to craft a flint knife(WIL). This is called the ATK, or attacking ability.

Yer character may have some skill or tool that adds a bonus to this Ability Score. A weapon for attacking, or gloves for climbing a rope, etc.

The task or creature or whatever else has some sort of active or passive opposition to this attack. To avoid a physical attack, this is DEX. A stuck door may have a "stuckness" value that you have to get higher than. A merchant you are haggling with has WIL. Running away from something is usuall DEX.  This is called DEF, and might be a fixed number, or might be a number of dice to roll.

In the case of a number of dice to roll, it may be capped by a maximum number. When the DEF roll is higher than the maximum, it becomes instead the maximum.
