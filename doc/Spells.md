# Spells

Spell level means the difficult level for a character's POW check. A level zero spell anybody can cast, provided it is known to them.

All spells have a cost. This can be paid in Mana, MP, or HP as desired by the player. One cannot cast spells at either 0 MP or 0 HP, but through paying for a casting they can bring their MP or HP to 0.

## Level Zero

### Second Chance

This spell is known to all characters.

Cost: 1

Allows the player to call for a single re-roll of dice. It does not need to be their own roll. It could be another players, or it could be the game master's.

When rerolling, all of the dice are rerolled, and the new dice are used instead. If a character has the mana, they can Second Chance it again. If another character has the mana, they can Second Chance it as well for as many times as they can pay for it.
