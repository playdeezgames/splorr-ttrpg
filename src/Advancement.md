# Character Advancement

For this, I am blatantly stealing Prof. DM's XP system.

I'm pretty sure he won't mind.

A character advances by obtaining 10XP, then performing some sort of milestone task.

XP are rewarded per gaming session, and each character gets between 1 and 5 XP.

Two categories of XP gained in a session:

Objectives: 0, 1, 2. If total failure, 0. If partial success 1. If full success 2.

Challenges: 1, 2, 3. If "just made it alive", then 1. If succeeded well, 2. If stellar performance ("Saving Private Ryan") then 3.

Usually 3-4 awarded per sesson, which means about every 3 sessions, a character will be ready for a milestone task.

Once at 10, XP freezes until the milestone task is accomplished, and then resets to 0.

Milestone tasks vary, and depend on what the character is wanting to advance.

A character may advance any of their abilities, including advancing a Power ability from 0 to 1.

A character may advance either HP or MP.

If the character wants to advance Strength, enter an arm wrestling tournament or go on a training journey. It should not be trivial to complete. It should be at least a session long to find the right place, perhaps the right item or the right trainer or whatever. Make it interesting.

Here's the limitations on advancement:

A character may not advance the same ability or stat twice in a row.
