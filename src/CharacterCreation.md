# Initial Marks for a new PC

Muscles, Moves, Mind and Moxie are a guaranteed minimum of 1. Magic starts at 0.

Roll 8d6. Treat them as individual dice rather than totalling them up.

Use Chart A to determine the effect of each die roll:

Chart A:
| Number | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | +1 Muscles |
| 2 | +1 Moves |
| 3 | +1 Mind |
| 4 | +1 Moxie |
| 5-6 | Roll again on chart B |

Chart B:
| Number | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | +1 Muscles |
| 2 | +1 Moves |
| 3 | +1 Mind |
| 4 | +1 Moxie |
| 5 | +1 Magic |
| 6 | Wild Card (choose any Mark to increase, including Magic) |

Notice that Magic will be uncommon to rare, and actual choice in PC generation just as rare. This is by design. Just roll up yer character and play them for their short, likely pointless life.

# Initial Strikes for a PC

There are two types of strikes: Physical and Mental

Typically each PC begins with 3 of each type of strike.

# Example Characters

## Example #1:

8d6 rolls a 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4 and results in a:

* Muscles: 1
* Moves: 3
* Mind: 2
* Moxie: 6
* Physical Strikes: 3
* Mental Strikes: 3

This character would make a good con artist, with their 6 moxie, and be decent at running away from trouble with their 3 moves, which is good because they are totally weak with the 1 muscles and not too bright with the 2 mind.

## Example #2:

8d6 yields 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6.

The 5, 6 re-rolls into 1, 3.

* Muscles: 3
* Moves: 2
* Mind: 5
* Moxie: 2
* Physical Strikes: 3
* Mental Strikes: 3

This character has average strength of 3, but is deficient somewhat in moves and moxie. Perhaps they are awkward physically and socially. However, they make up for this with the 5 in mind, two points above average. This character is a thinker, not a doer or talker.

## Example #3:

8d6 results in 2, 2, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6.

The 5, 5, 5, 5, 6 rerolls into 1, 3, 3, 3, 4.

* Muscles: 2
* Moves: 3
* Mind: 4
* Moxie: 3
* Physical Strikes: 3
* Mental Strikes: 3

This is a nearly average character. The only distinction is that they are slightly above average in mind and slightly below average in muscles. Maybe they chose academic pursuits instead of athletic ones.

And this example goes to show: even an early result with five of the eight dice to re-roll doesn't guarantee magical ability or actual choice.

## Nerdy Math Probability Stuff

Because of probabilities, here are the average marks of a newly generated player character:

* Muscles: 2.778 (~3)
* Moves: 2.778 (~3)
* Mind: 2.778 (~3)
* Moxie: 2.778 (~3)
* Magic: 0.889<sup>1</sup> (~1)

<sup>1</sup> assuming that a 5 or 6 rerolled as a 6 is spent on magic.

# Questions that you did not ask that I decided to answer anyway!

## Why such a low chance of magical ability?

SPLORR!! is "low fantasy" game. Magic in most games is "cheating". You have an opportunity for magic, it is just low. It will make you value the rare opportunities more.

## Why so little choice in character creation? 

SPLORR!! is a brutal world, and those who grow up there do not have a lot of choices in life. Choice is a luxury primarily for the wealthy and powerful, but on occasion will grace the lucky instead. On average, there is a 22.2% chance that there will be at least one point that the player can spend on a mark of their choosing. It is an uncommon and special thing! Almost certainly, you will spend it to get a point of magic.

Additionally, one of the main design goals is quick starting and fast playing. When you spend hours on yer character, you get invested. When yer invested, yer sad when yer character dies. It if only took 30 seconds to roll up yer character, how invested are you? You won't mind when they die. WHEN, not if. SPLORR!! characters are initially very squishy and hence disposable.
