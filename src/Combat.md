# Combat

There are two arenas of combat, physical and mental.

## Physical Combat

One character attempts to physically strike another.

That makes them the attacker.

The attacker makes an attack roll.

That attack roll is based on the Muscles and added to by whatever they are wielding as a weapon.

If the attack roll is zero, then we're done. Next character gets a chance to act.

The defender makes a defend roll.

The defend roll is based on the Moves adjusted for any items that aid in this mark.

Damage is the attack roll minus the defend roll.

If damage is positive, then the defender takes a physical strike, either to some sort of armor they are wearing or to their body.

If the damage is taken by armor, perform a saving throw or it get a physical strike. Once armor is out of physical strike, it is damaged and no longer useful in combat until repaired.

If damage is applied to armor, the weapon used must make a saving throw or it is struck or damaged in a similar manner to armor.

When a character's own physical strikes are gone, they are incapacitated and unconscious. Overstrikes kill the character immediately. Incapacitated characters offer no defense for further strikes, and any further physical strikes will kill the character.

## Mental Combat

One character attempts to taunt, intimidate, or belittle another character.

This character is called the Attacker.

The Attacker rolls their Moxie, with whatever Moxie enhancements they may have. This is the attack roll.

If the attack roll is zero, go no further. Next character' action.

The Defender rolls their Mind, with whatever Mind enhancements they may have. This the defend roll.

Damage is attack roll minus defend roll.

The damage is applied either to the defender's mental strike or to some item that adds mental strike. These are rare, but do exist, like a medicine bag. Treat these things like armor. They have a saving throw just like armor.

If the attacker is using some sort of item to enhance their Moxie for this attack, it, too must make a saving throw or take strikes.

Once the defender is brought to zero or lower in mental strike, he surrenders.

# Moar Questions You Did Not Ask

## Mental Combat? Why?

In a brutal world, brutal things happen.

Most enemies are content to kill you and take whatever you happen to be carrying. Life is cheap in SPLORR!!

Others wish to.... make use of your labor, or to trade goods for the use of your labor to others. In a brutal world atrocious things happen.

## What happens to weapons and armor and other things that are damaged in combat?

You fix it, duh.

Broken things either require strength (Muscles), manual dexterity (Moves), or brain power (Mind) to repair. Usually there is a need for supplied to aid with this repair. You'll figure it out.

If you don't have any of those things, you might try convincing a skilled laborer (with yer Moxie) to do it for you at a fair price.

Or, you just get a new one. Maybe you can loot those orcs you killed for a new short sword....
