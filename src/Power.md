# Power

It's magic. It is psionic powers. It is superhuman abilities. It is mutant powers. Whatever. Its cheaty magic stuff!

## Using Power

You can use Power any time you want on any task you want, as long as you have 1MP or 1HP to spend.

Which means that a starting character has 4 times to use Power without having to worry about much.  Once at 0MP, yer character is extremely easy to demoralize and dominate and at 0HP, yer character is ready to topple over dead.

Once power is used and the price (either 1HP or 1MP) is paid, you get to use yer Power dice to aid ONE action for some other ability score.

If you are lifting something heavy, then you add Power to Strength. If you are doing some dangerous stunt, add Power to Dexterity. If you are researching something, Willpower. If you are convincing someone, Influence.

Early on, Power isn't that great a help, but eventually it becomes quite useful.
