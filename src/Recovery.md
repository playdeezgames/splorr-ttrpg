# Recovery of HP and MP

When a character sleeps, they may recover one MP and one HP.

One. ONE? 

This is for NATURAL recovery due to rest.

There are items and medicines that will speed this up.

But it is unlikely that a new character will have access to these things.

## Potions of Health

The work like this:

They vary based on their components, age, skill of manufacture, and a blizzard of other factors.

This reduces to a Healing, Minimum, and Maximum.

The Healing is a number of dice to roll for the effect of the potion. Like everything, you count the 6s. 

The Minimum is the minimum benefit, even if the roll is less.

The Maximum is the maximum benefit, even if the roll is higher.

### Typical Potion of Health

The Typical Potion will give 1 HP of Healing (~93%), 2 HP of Healing (~7%) or on rare occasion 3 HP of Healing (~0.5%). We call this "better than nothing".

### Good Potion of Health

* Minimum: 1
